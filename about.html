                    BoilerChad is the health related website that covers the fields of diet, workingout, and lifting. <br />
                    This project is primarily motivated from a lot of Boilermakers who commit large amount of their time at the COREC, exercising, working out, <br />and all other activities related to the physical activities. 
                    With this being said, this website would guide the user on several topics, as previously mentioned. <br />
                    The user can choose a specific portal to go to based on what they are looking for, and based on their input information <br /> (ex: I want to [gain/lose] weights by [user input] lbs within [user input] period of time. OR I want to work out for [user input] times/week. Generate the workout plan.), <br /> the calculator would generate the corresponding outputs.
